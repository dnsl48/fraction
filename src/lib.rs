#![doc(test(attr(deny(warnings),allow(deprecated))))]

//! Fraction is designed to be a precise lossless drop-in replacement for floating types (f32, f64).
//!
//! It comes with a number of predefined type aliases covering the most common use cases such as
//! [Fraction], [Decimal], [BigFraction], [DynaDecimal] and so on (see [prelude] module for more examples).
//!
//! The public API provides you with the generic types that you may use straightforwardly to build your
//! own types, suiting your needs best (see [prelude] module for the examples).
//!
//! # Library features
//!
//! - Drop in replacement for floats with the exception for NaN == NaN so that it's hashable
//! - It's hashable, so may be used as values in Sets and keys in dictionaries and hash maps
//! - [Fraction](GenericFraction) type, representing floats as fractions
//! - [Decimal](GenericDecimal) type, based on [Fraction](GenericFraction) type represents floats as lossless decimals
//! - [DynaInt](dynaint) implements dinamically growing integer type that perfarms checked math and avoids stack overflows
//! - PostgreSQL binary protocol integration for both fractions and decimals
//! - Juniper support for both fractions and decimals
//! - [Generic integer conversions](generic), such as `i8 -> u8`, `usize -> u8` and so on
//! - [Lossless division](division) with no allocations and infinite precision
//!
//! # Disclaimer
//! Bugs to be expected!  
//! Even though we do our best to keep it well covered with tests, it is not enterprise ready yet.  
//! When it gets stable we will release the version 1.0.0.  
//! You may find more info about Semantic Versioning on [https://semver.org/](https://semver.org/).  
//! You are very welcome to report bugs or make other contributions.
//!
//! # Crate features
//! - `with-bigint` (default) integration with [num::BigInt] and [num::BigUint] data types
//! - `with-decimal` (default) [Decimal] type implemented upon [GenericFraction]
//! - `with-dynaint` (default) dynamically growing integer avoiding stack overflows
//! - `with-juniper-support` [Juniper](https://crates.io/crates/juniper) integration
//! - `with-postgres-support` [PostgreSQL](https://crates.io/crates/postgres) integration; Numeric/Decimal type
//! - `with-serde-support` [Serde](https://crates.io/crates/serde) traits implementation
//!
//! # Implementation
//! Basic math implemented upon the [num] crate (in particular the [num::rational] module).  
//! The utilised traits from the [num] crate are re-exported, so you don't have to explicitly depend on that crate however,
//! you may import them from either of crates if necessary.
//!
//! # Usage
//! To start using the library look no further than [Prelude](self::prelude) module.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ### Simple Fraction use:
//! ```
//! type F = fraction::Fraction;
//!
//! let result = F::from(0.5) / F::from(0.3);
//! assert_eq!(format!("{}", result), "+5/3");
//! ```
//!
//! ### Simple Decimal use:
//!
//! ```
//! type D = fraction::Decimal;
//!
//! let result = D::from(0.5) / D::from(0.3);
//! assert_eq!(format!("{:.4}", result), "1.6666");
//! ```
//!
//! ### Generic integer conversion
//! ```
//! use fraction::{Sign, GenericFraction};
//!
//! type F = GenericFraction<u32>;
//!
//! let fra = F::new_generic(Sign::Plus, 1i8, 42usize).unwrap();
//! assert_eq!(fra, F::new(1u32, 42u32));
//! ```
//!
//! ### Postgres usage
//! Postgres uses i16 for its binary protocol, so you'll have to use at least u16
//! as the base type for fractions/decimals.
//! Otherwise you may workaround with DynaInt<u8, _something_more_than_u8_>.
//! The safest way to go with would be DynaInt based types
//! such as DynaFraction or DynaDecimal as they would prevent
//! stack overflows for high values.
//!
//! Beware bad numbers such as 1/3, 1/7.
//! Fraction keeps the highest achievable precision (up to 16383 digits after floating point).
//! Decimal uses its own precision.
//! So, if you may end up with bad numbers, it may be preferable to go with Decimals over Fractions.
//!
//! Both types (fractions and decimals) should work transparently
//! in accordance with Postgres crate documentation
